# Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz - BetrVG)

Full citation:  Works Constitution Act of 25 September 2001 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 2518), as amended by Article 6d of the Act of 16 September 2022 (Federal Law Gazette p. 1454)

# Part One: General provisions

<span id="1"></span>
### Section 1: Establishment of works councils
---

<span id="1-1"></span>
(1) Works councils are elected in all establishments that normally have five or more permanent employees with voting rights, including three who are eligible. The same applies to joint establishments of several companies.

<span id="1-2"></span>
(2) A joint establishment of several companies is assumed to exist if

1. the companies employ the equipment and employees jointly in order to pursue their working objectives, or
2. splitting a company would have the effect that one or several departments of an establishment would be allocated to another company that is involved in the split, without thereby fundamentally changing the organisation of the establishment concerned.

<span id="2"></span>
### Section 2: Status of trade unions and employers’ associations
---

<span id="2-1"></span>
(1) The employer and the works council work together in a spirit of mutual trust having regard to the applicable collective agreements and in co-operation with the trade unions and employers’ associations represented in the establishment for the good of the employees and of the establishment.

<span id="2-2"></span>
(2) In order to permit the trade unions represented in the establishment to exercise the powers and duties established by this Act, their agents, after notification of the employer or his representative, are to be granted access to the establishment, in so far as this does not run counter to essential operational requirements, mandatory safety rules or the protection of trade secrets.

<span id="2-3"></span>
(3) This Act does not affect the functions of trade unions and employers’ associations and more particularly the representation of their members’ interests.

<span id="3"></span>
### Section 3: Different arrangements
---

<span id="3-1"></span>
(1) The following may be determined by collective agreements:

1. for companies comprising several establishments
   * a) the formation of a uniform works council for the company, or
   * b) the combination of companies or establishments  
     if the formation of works councils is thereby facilitated, or if this combination serves the appropriate safeguarding of the employees’ interests;
2. for companies and combines, to the extent that they have been organised according to product- or project-specific divisions (branches) and the branch management also makes decision concerning issues that require participation, the formation of works councils for the branches (branch works councils), if this arrangement serves to appropriately carry out the works council’s duties;
3. other employees’ representation structures to the extent that these structures serve an efficient and appropriate representation of employees’ interests, in particular,because of the organisation of the establishment, company, or combine, or because of other types of cooperation between companies;
4. additional bodies under the Works Constitution Act (working groups) that serve for the inter-company co-operation of employees’ representations;
5. additional employees’ representations under the Works Constitution Act that facilitate cooperation between the works council and the employees.

<span id="3-2"></span>
(2) If no provisions are included in a collective agreement that cover the cases listed in [paragraph (1)](#3-1) no. 1, 2, 4, or 5, and if no other collective agreement is available, such an arrangement can be agreed upon in a works agreement.

<span id="3-3"></span>
(3) If no provisions are included in a collective agreement that cover the case described in [paragraph (1)](#3-1) no. 1 letter a), and if there is no works council in the establishment, a majority of employees can resolve to elect a uniform works council. This vote can be initiated by a minimum of three employees with voting rights employed by the establishment, or by a trade union represented in the establishment.

<span id="3-4"></span>
(4) Unless provided otherwise in the collective agreement or the works agreement, the arrangements specified in [paragraph (1)](#3-1) no. 1 to 3 are to be applied for the first time in the course of the next regular works council elections, unless no works council exists, or unless the works council has to be re-elected for other reasons. If the collective agreement or the works agreement provides for another voting time, the term of office of existing works councillors, who will become obsolete under [paragraph (1)](#3-1) no. 1 to 3 terminate upon announcement of the election results.

<span id="3-5"></span>
(5) The organisation units under the Works Constitution Act, which were established on the basis of a collective agreement or a plant-level agreement in accordance with [paragraph (1)](#3-1) no. 1 to 3, are considered establishments for the purposes of this Act. The provisions concerning the rights and obligations of the works council and the legal position of its members are applicable to the employees’ representations formed therein.

<span id="4"></span>
### Section 4: Separate departments, very small establishments
---

<span id="4-1"></span>
(1) Separate departments of establishments are regarded as independent establishments if they meet the conditions laid down in [section 1 (1)](#1-1) sentence 1 and

1.  are situated at a considerable distance from the principal establishment, or
2.  are independent by reason of their function and organization.

The employees of a separate department, in which no separate works council exists, may resolve by a simple majority of votes and without complying with a special form that they will participate in the works council elections of the principal establishment; [section 3 (3)](#3-3) sentence 2 applies accordingly. The vote may also be initiated by the works council of the principal establishment. The resolution is to be communicated to the works council of the principal establishment not later than ten weeks before expiry of its term of office. [Sentence 2 to 4 of](#4-1) this paragraph apply accordingly to the revocation of the resolution.

<span id="4-2"></span>
(2) Establishments that do not meet the conditions laid down in [section 1 (1)](#1-1) sentence 1 are treated as part of the principal establishment.

<span id="5"></span>
### Section 5: Employees
---

<span id="5-1"></span>
(1) In this Act the term “employee” (male and female) comprises wage earners and salaried employees including persons employed for the purpose of their vocational training, regardless of whether they are engaged in indoor work, in field service, or in tele-work. The term includes persons engaged in home work who work principally for one and the same establishment. Furthermore, (female and male) civil servants, (female and male) soldiers and employees of the public service, including persons employed for the purpose of their vocational training, are considered "employees" if they work in establishments organised under private law.

<span id="5-2"></span>
(2) The following are not to be considered as employees for the purposes of this Act:

1.  in establishments belonging to a corporation, the members of the organs that are legally empowered to represent the corporation;
2.  partners in an ordinary commercial partnership or members of another association of persons in the establishment belonging to the partnership or association, in so far as they are empowered by law, its own by-laws or the articles of association to represent the association or to exercise management functions;
3.  persons whose employment is not primarily for the purpose of earning their livelihood but is chiefly inspired by charitable or religious motives;
4.  persons whose employment is not primarily for the purpose of earning their livelihood but principally for their cure or recovery, rehabilitation, moral improvement or education;
5.  the spouse, the life partner, as well as the relatives by blood or marriage of the first degree living with the employer.

<span id="5-3"></span>

Sentence 1 and 2 apply accordingly to the civil servants and soldiers referred to in paragraph 1 sentence 3.

<span id="5-4"></span>
(4) In case of doubt, executive staff under [paragraph (3)](#5-3) no. 3, are employees who

---

<span id="16-1"></span>
(1) Not less than ten weeks before the end of its term of office, the works council appoints an electoral board of three persons with voting rights, one of whom is the chairperson. The works council may increase the number of members on the electoral board if the proper conduct of the election so requires. In all cases the electoral board must consist of an odd number of members. A substitute may be appointed for each member of the electoral board in order to replace him in his or her absence. In establishments with male and female employees, the electoral board is to comprise women and men. Each trade union represented in the establishment may, in addition, delegate a representative belonging to the establishment to the electoral board as a non-voting member, insofar as no voting member of the electoral board belongs to the trade union involved.

<span id="16-2"></span>
(2) If no electoral board has been appointed by the beginning of the eighth week before the end of the term of office of the works council, it is appointed by the labour court on application from three or more persons with voting rights or a trade union represented in the establishment. The preceding paragraph applies accordingly. The application may contain proposals as to the composition of the electoral board. In the case of establishments that normally employ more than twenty employees with voting rights the labour court may also appoint as members of the electoral board persons who are not employed in the establishment but belong to a trade union represented in the establishment, if the proper conduct of the election so requires.

<span id="16-3"></span>

<span id="17-2"></span>
(2) If there is neither a central works council nor combine works council, an electoral board is elected at a works meeting of the employees on a majority vote of those present; [section 16 (1)](#16-1) applies accordingly.

<span id="17-3"></span>
(3) Such works meeting may be called by three employees of the establishment with voting rights or a trade union represented in the establishment; in doing so, the said employees or trade union may make proposals as to the composition of the electoral board.

<span id="17-4"></span>
(4) If a works meeting thus called is not held or fails to elect an electoral board, the board is appointed by the labour court on application from three or more persons with voting rights or a trade union represented in the establishment. [Section 16 (2)](#16-2) applies accordingly.

<span id="17a"></span>

4.  [Section 17 (4)](#17-4) applies accordingly if no election meeting takes place although it has been properly convened, or if no electoral board was elected at the election meeting.

<span id="18"></span>
### Section 18: Preparation and conduct of the election
---

<span id="18-1"></span>
(1) The electoral board has to call the election without delay, carry it out and announce the results. If the electoral board fails to carry out this duty, the labour court acts in its place on application of the works council, of three or more employees with voting rights or a trade union represented in the establishment. [Section 16 (2)](#16-2) applies accordingly.

<span id="18-2"></span>
(2) If there is any doubt as to whether an organisation unit qualifies for having a works council, the employer, any interested electoral board member or a trade union represented in the establishment is entitled to apply to the labour court for a decision.

### Section 18a: Allocation of executive staff for elections

<span id="18a-1"></span>
(1) If the elections are to be held at the same time in accordance with [section 13 (1)](#13-1) and [section 5 (1)](#5-1) of the Executives’ Committee Act (Sprecherausschussgesetz), the electoral boards notify each other immediately after preparation of the voters’ lists, but not later than two weeks prior to the start of the elections, which salaried employees have been allocated to the executive staff; this also applies if the elections are held at the same time without the existence of a legal obligation. Insofar as there is no agreement between the electoral boards regarding this allocation, an attempt must be made to reach an agreement in a joint meeting. Insofar as agreement is reached, the salaried employees are to be entered in the appropriate voters’ list in accordance with their allocation.

<span id="18a-2"></span>
(2) Insofar as no agreement is reached, a mediator has to make a renewed attempt to achieve agreement between the electoral boards regarding allocation, this occurring not less than one week before the start of the elections. The employer has to support the mediator at his or her request, particularly by providing the necessary information and documentation. If this attempt to reach agreement fails, the mediator decides after consultation with the employer. [Paragraph (1)](#18a-1) sentence 3 applies accordingly.

<span id="18a-3"></span>
(3) The electoral boards must agree on the mediator. Only an employee of the establishment or of another establishment of the company or combine, or the employer may be appointed as mediator. If no agreement is reached, the electoral boards each propose one person as a mediator; the casting of lots decides who will act as mediator.

<span id="18a-4"></span>
(4) If an election in accordance with the Executives’ Committee Act is not held at the same time as the election in accordance with [section 13 (1)](#13-1) or [(2)](#13-2), the electoral board has to notify the executives’ committee in accordance with [paragraph (1)](#18a-1) sentence 1 clause 1. If there is disagreement regarding allocation, the executives’ committee has to appoint members to participate in the allocation procedure in lieu of the electoral board. If an election in accordance with this Act is not held at the same time as the election in accordance with [section 5 (1)](#5-1) or [(2)](#5-2) of the Executives’ Committee Act, sentence 1 and 2 apply to the works council accordingly.

<span id="18a-5"></span>
(5) Recourse to the courts of law is not excluded by the allocation. Contestation of the works council election or the election in accordance with the Executives’ Committee Act is excluded, insofar as it is based on the claim that the allocation was incorrect. Sentence 2 does not apply if the allocation is patently incorrect.

<span id="19"></span>
### Section 19: Contesting of elections
---

<span id="19-1"></span>
(1) An election may be contested before the labour court, if any of the essential rules respecting the right to vote, eligibility or electoral procedure have been infringed and no subsequent correction has been made, unless the infringement could not have altered or influenced the election results.

<span id="19-2"></span>
(2) Such contestation may be made by any three or more persons with voting rights, a trade union represented in the establishment or the employer. To be receivable the action must be brought within two weeks of the announcement of the election results.

<span id="19-3"></span>
(3) Contestation by the employees entitled to vote is excluded insofar as it is based on the incorrectness of the list of candidates unless an objection has been lodged to the correctness of the list of candidates before for the same reason. This does not apply if the contesting employees entitled to vote were prevented from lodging an objection. Contestation by the employer is excluded if it is based on the incorrectness of the list of candidates and if this incorrectness is based on the employer's information.

<span id="20"></span>
### Section 20: Protection against obstruction and costs of the election
---

<span id="20-1"></span>
(1) No person may obstruct the election of a works council. In particular, no employee may be restricted in his right to vote or to stand for election.

<span id="20-2"></span>
(2) Any attempt to influence a works council election by inflicting or threatening any unfavourable treatment or by granting or promising any advantage is unlawful.

<span id="20-3"></span>
(3) The costs of the election are borne by the employer. Any loss of working time entailed by voting, performance of duties on the electoral board or activity as a mediator ([section 18a](#18a)) does not give the employer a right to reduce the remuneration.

In particular, the works council must immediately appoint electoral boards. The transitional mandate ends as soon as a new works council has been elected in the departments and the election results have been announced, but in any case not later than six months after the split has become effective. The transitional mandate may be extended by six more months by a collective agreement or works agreement.

<span id="21a-2"></span>

(3) Where the employer has grossly violated his or her duties under this Act, the works council or a trade union represented in the establishment may apply to the labour court for an order to the employer enjoining him to cease and desist from an act, allow an act to be performed or perform an act. If the employer does not obey an executory court order to cease and desist from an act or allow an act to be performed, the labour court, on application and after prior warning, is to impose a fine on him or her for each such violation. If the employer does not carry out an act imposed on him or her by an executory court order, the labour court, on application, has to give a decision that he or she is made to perform the act imposed on him or her subject to payment of fines.

Operational reasons are also present if the works council activities cannot be carried out during the personal working hours because of different working hours of the works council members.

<span id="37-4"></span>
(4) During his or her term of office and for one year thereafter the remuneration of a member of the works council may not be fixed at a lower rate than the remuneration paid to employees in a comparable position who have followed the career that is usual in the establishment.

(6) Paragraphs [(2)](#37-2) and [(3)](#37-3) apply accordingly to the participation of training and educational courses, in so far as the knowledge imparted is necessary for the activities of the works council. Operational reasons as defined in paragraph [(3)](#37-3) are also present if the training is provided to the works council member outside his working hours due to special features of the establishment’s working hours regulations; in this case, the claim for compensation is limited to the working hours of one full-time employee per day of training, taking into account the releases stipulated in [paragraph (2)](#37-2) hereof. In scheduling the time for attending training and educational courses the works council has to take account of the operational requirements of the establishment. It has to notify the employer in good time of the participation in training and educational courses and of the time at which they are held.

[Paragraph (6)](#37-6) sentence 2 to 6 applies.

<span id="38"></span>
### Section 38: Releases
---

<span id="38-1"></span>

* 501 to 900 employees 2 members of the works council
* 901 to 1500 employees 3 members of the works council
* 1501 to 2000 employees 4 members of the works council
* 2001 to 3000 employees 5 members of the works council

In establishments with more than 10,000 employees one further member of the works council is to be released for each additional fraction of 2,000 employees. Releases may also be granted in the form of partial releases. Taken together, such partial releases may not exceed the amount of releases specified in sentence 1 and 2. Other arrangements concerning releases can be made by collective or works agreement.

<span id="38-2"></span>
(2) The works council members to be released are elected by secret ballot and in accordance with the principles of proportional representation by the works council from its midst after consultation with the employer. If only one list of candidates is proposed, the ballot is carried out in accordance with the principles of the majority vote; if only one works council member is to be released, he or she is elected by simple majority. The works council has to give the employer the names of the members to be released. If the employer feels that the release is not justifiable under the circumstances, he or she may appeal to the conciliation committee within two weeks of being notified. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the works council. If the conciliation committee confirms the concern of the employer, it also has to take into account the protection of minorities within the meaning of sentence 1 when deciding upon another works council member to be released. If the employer does not appeal to the conciliation committee, his approval is deemed to have been given and the releases takes effect on the expiry of the two weeks referred to above. [Section 27 (1)](#27-1) sentence 5 applies accordingly to removal of members from office.

<span id="38-3"></span>
(3) In respect of members of the works council who have been released from their work duties for three full consecutive terms of office, the period during which their remuneration continues pursuant to [section 37 (4)](#37-4) and their employment pursuant to [37 (5)](#37-5) is extended to two years after the expiry of their term of office.

<span id="38-4"></span>
(4) Members of the works council who have been released from their work duties may not be debarred from vocational training programmes inside or outside the establishment. Within a year of the date on which the release comes to an end, members of the works council are to be allowed, as far as the facilities offered by the establishment permit, to take any career training normally provided for the employees of the establishment that they missed because of their release. In respect of members of the works council who were released from their work duties for three full consecutive terms of office, the period referred to in the preceding sentence is extended to two years.

### Section 39: Consultation hours

<span id="39-2"></span>
(2) If the youth and trainee delegation does not have its own consultation hours, a member of the youth and trainee delegation may take part in the consultation hours held by the works council for the purpose of advising the employees referred to in [section 60 (1)](#60-1)

<span id="39-3"></span>
(3) Any loss of working time entailed by making use of consultation hours or otherwise seeking the assistance of the works council does not give the employer a right to reduce the employee’s remuneration.

<span id="76-1"></span>
(1) Whenever the need arises a conciliation committee is to be set up for the purpose of settling differences of opinion between the employer and the works council, central works council or combine works council. A standing conciliation committee may be established by works agreement.

<span id="76-2"></span>

Maximum rates are to be established in the remuneration regulations. In this case, the time required, the complexity of the dispute and the loss of earnings are to be taken into account, in particular. The remuneration of the assessors is to be lower than that of the chairperson. When establishing the maximum rates, the rightful interests of the members of the conciliation committee and the employer are to be taken into account.

<span id="76a-5"></span>
(5) [Paragraph (3)](#76a-3) and remuneration regulations in accordance with [paragraph (4)](#76a-4) may be deviated from by way of a collective agreement or in a works agreement, if a collective agreement permits this or if no such collective agreement exists.

The employer and the works council support each other in complying with data protection law. The data protection officer is obliged to maintain confidentiality vis-à-vis the employer with regard to information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the works council’s opinion-forming process. Section 6 (5) sentence 2 and section 38 (2) of the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) also apply with regard to the relationship between the data protection officer and the employer.

At its request, the works council is to be granted access at any time to any documentation it may require for the discharge of its duties; in this connection the works committee or a committee set up pursuant to [section 28](#28) is entitled to inspect the payroll showing the gross wages and salaries of the employees. The required documentation also includes the contracts on which the employment of the persons referred to in sentence 1 is based. The employer has to provide knowledgeable personnel as informers to the works council, if necessary for the proper discharge of its functions, having due regard to the suggestions of the works council, except where this is precluded by imperative operational requirements.

<span id="80-3"></span>

Insofar as the works council has to assess the introduction or application of artificial intelligence in order to carry out its tasks, it is deemed necessary to call on the advice of an expert in this regard. The same applies if the employer and the works council agree on a permanent expert on matters referred to in sentence 2.

<span id="80-4"></span>
(4) The informers and experts are bound to observe secrecy accordingly, as prescribed in [section 79](#79).

3.  if there is factual reason to assume that the staff measure is likely to result in the dismissal of or other prejudice to employees of the establishment not warranted by operational or personal reasons; in cases of permanent recruitment non-consideration of an equally suitable employee on a fixed term contract also considers a prejudice to that employee;
4.  if the employee concerned suffers prejudice through the staff measure although this is not warranted by operational or personal reasons;
5.  if the vacancy has not been notified in the establishment as required under [section 93](#93); or
6.  if there is reason based on facts to assume that the applicant or employee envisaged for the staff movement would cause trouble in the establishment through unlawful conduct or gross violation of the principles laid down in [section 75 (1)](#75-1), in particular through racist or xenophobic activities.

<span id="99-3"></span>

In such cases the employer has to inform the employee concerned of the position in fact and in law.

<span id="100-2"></span>
(2) The employer has to immediately notify the works council of the temporary staff measure. If the works council contends the urgency of the action taken on grounds based on facts, it has to immediately report its objection to the employer. In such cases the employer may maintain the temporary staff measure only on condition that within three days he applies to the labour court for a decision in lieu of the consent of the works council and for a declaration stating that the action taken was urgently required for reasons based on facts.

<span id="100-3"></span>
(3) If the labour court by mandatory decision refuses to issue a decision in lieu of the works council’s consent or if it hands down a final mandatory judgement to the effect that the action taken was manifestly not urgently required by reasons based on facts, the temporary staff measure is cancelled on the expiry of two weeks after the date on which the decision or judgement becomes operative. After that date it is unlawful to maintain the staff movement.

<span id="102-2"></span>
(2) If the works council has objections to a dismissal with due notice, it has to notify the employer in writing within a week giving its reasons. If it does not report its objections within the said time limit, it is deemed to have given its consent to the dismissal. If the works council has objections against a dismissal without notice, it has to notify the employer in writing immediately and at any rate not later than within three days, giving its reasons. The works council is to consult the employee concerned before it takes a stand, in so far as this appears necessary. [Section 99 (1)](#99-1) sentence 3 applies accordingly.

<span id="102-3"></span>
(3) The works council may oppose a dismissal with due notice within the time limit specified in [paragraph (2)](#102-2) sentence 1 in the following cases:

1.  if the employer in selecting the employee to be dismissed disregarded or did not take sufficient account of social aspects;
2.  if the dismissal amounted to non-observance of a guideline covered by [section 95](#95);
3.  if the employee whose dismissal is being envisaged could be kept on at another job in the same establishment or in another establishment of the same company;
4.  if the employee could be kept on after a reasonable amount of retraining or further training; or
5.  if the employee could be kept on after a change in the terms of his contract and he has indicated his agreement to such change.

<span id="102-4"></span>
(4) If the employer gives notice of dismissal although the works council has lodged objections to such dismissal under [paragraph (3)](#102-3), it has to append a copy of the works council’s point of view to the notice of dismissal sent to the employee.

<span id="102-5"></span>
(5) If the works council has lodged an objection to a routine dismissal within the period and in the manner prescribed and if the employee has brought an action under the **Protection against Dismissal Act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz)** for a declaration that the employment relationship has not been dissolved by the notice of dismissal, the employer is bound to keep the employee in his or her employment at the latter’s request after expiry of the term of notice until a final decision is given on the case at issue; during such period he or she may not make any change in his or her conditions of work. On application by the employer the court may issue an interim order releasing him from his obligation under sentence 1 to maintain the employment relationship in the following cases:

1.  if the action brought by the employee is not reasonably likely to succeed or appears abusive; or
2.  the continuation of the employment relationship imposes an unreasonable financial burden on the employer; or
3.  the objection raised by the works council is manifestly unfounded.

<span id="102-6"></span>
(6) The employer and the works council may make an agreement to the effect that any notice of dismissal requires the approval of the works council and that differences of opinion on whether a refusal of consent is justified are to be submitted to the decision of the conciliation committee.

<span id="102-7"></span>
(7) The foregoing is without prejudice to the regulations relating to the participation of the works council made under the Protection against Dismissal Act.

<span id="103"></span>
### Section 103: Exceptional dismissal and transfer in special cases
---

<span id="103-1"></span>
(1) The exceptional dismissal of a member of the works council, the youth and trainee delegation, the ship’s committee and the fleet works council, the electoral board or of candidates for election requires the consent of the works council.

<span id="103-2"></span>
(2) If the works council refuses its consent, the employer may apply to the labour court for a decision in lieu of consent if the exceptional dismissal is justified, all circumstances being taken into account. The employee concerned is a party to the proceedings in the labour court.

(2a) [Paragraph 2](#103-2) applies accordingly if the establishment does not have a works council.

<span id="103-3"></span>
(3) A transfer of the persons referred to in [paragraph (1)](#103-1), which would result in the loss of an office or of eligibility, requires the approval of the works council; the foregoing does not apply if the employee concerned agrees to the transfer. [Paragraph (2)](#103-2) applies accordingly subject to the proviso that the employer may apply to the labour court for a decision in lieu of consent if the transfer is warranted by important operational reasons, even with due regard to the position of the employee concerned under the Works Constitution Act.

<span id="104"></span>
### Section 104: Removal of employees causing trouble in the establishment
---

If an employee through unlawful conduct or gross violation of the principles laid down in [section 75 (1)](#75-1), in particular, through racist or xenophobic activities, repeatedly causes serious trouble in the establishment, the works council may request the employer to dismiss or transfer him. If the labour court upholds an application by the works council to enjoin the employer to dismiss or transfer the said employee and the employer does not dismiss or transfer him in violation of a mandatory court order, the labour court, on application by the works council, has to compel the employer to comply with the order by the imposition of fines. The maximum fine is 250 euros in respect of each day on which the violation continues.

<span id="105"></span>
### Section 105: Executive staff

<span id="106-1"></span>
(1) A finance committee is to be established in all companies that normally have more than 100 permanent employees. It is the duty of the finance committee to consult with the employer on financial matters and report to the works council.

<span id="106-2"></span>
(2) The employer has to inform the finance committee in full and in good time of the financial affairs of the company and supply the relevant documentation in so far as there is no risk of disclosing the trade or business secrets of the company and demonstrate the implications for manpower planning. In the cases referred to in [paragraph 3](#106-3) no. 9a, the relevant documentation includes information regarding the potential acquirer and his/her intentions with respect to the company's future business activity and the resulting consequences for employees; the same applies in the case where a bidding process is conducted in the run-up to the takeover.

<span id="106-3"></span>
(3) The following, inter alia, are financial matters covered by this provision:

1.  the economic and financial situation of the company;
2.  production and marketing situation;

### Section 107: Appointment and composition of the finance committee
---

<span id="107-1"></span>
(1) The finance committee consists of not less than three and not more than seven members, who are employees of the company and at least one of whom is a works council member. The executives referred to in [section 5 (3)](#5-3) are also eligible for membership on the finance committee. The committee members should have the necessary technical and personal qualifications for their functions.

<span id="107-2"></span>
(2) The members of the finance committee are appointed by the works council for a period corresponding to its own term of office. Where a central works council has been established, the members of the finance committee are appointed by the said council; in this case the term of office of the committee members ends on the expiration date for the term of office of the majority of the members of the central works council who were entitled to participate in making the appointments. Members of the finance committee may be removed from office at any time; sentence 1 and 3 apply accordingly to removal from office.

<span id="107-3"></span>
(3) The works council may decide by majority vote of its members to assign the functions of the finance committee to a committee of the works council. The membership of such committee may not exceed the number of members of the works committee. The works council may, however, appoint additional employees including executive staff specified in [section 5 (3)](#5-3) to the committee but not more than the number of committee members; the decisions are to be taken in accordance with sentence 1. The additional employees referred to in sentence 3 are accordingly bound to secrecy in accordance with [section 79](#79). For amending or annulling decisions taken in accordance with sentence 1 to 3 the same majority is required as for the adoption of decisions under sentence 1 to 3. If a company has a central works council, the said council decides on the assignment of functions of the finance committee to other committees; sentence 1 to 5 apply accordingly.

<span id="108"></span>

<span id="108-1"></span>
(1) The finance committee is to meet once a month.

<span id="108-2"></span>

(4) The finance committee is to give a full report on each meeting to the works council without delay.

<span id="108-5"></span>
(5) The annual balance sheet is to be explained to the finance committee in conjunction with the works council.

<span id="108-6"></span>
(6) Where the works council or central works council has decided to assign the functions of the finance committee to another committee, [paragraphs (1)](#108-1) to [(5)](#108-5) apply accordingly.


<span id="109"></span>
### Section 109: Settlement of differences
---

If despite a request from the finance committee information on financial matters as defined in [section 106](#106) is not furnished or not furnished in good time or if the information given is inadequate and if no agreement on the matter is reached between the employer and the works council, the matter is decided by the conciliation committee. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the works council. The conciliation committee may call in experts if it needs their evidence to reach a decision; [section 80 (4)](#80-4) applies. Where the works council or the central works council has decided to assign the functions of the finance committee to another committee, sentence 1 applies accordingly.

<span id="109a"></span>
### Section 109a: Takeover
---

In companies where no financial committee has been established, the works council is to be involved as stipulated in [section 106 (1)](#106-1) and [(2)](#106-2), in the case covered by [section 106 (3)](#106-3) no. 9a; [section 109](#109) applies accordingly.

<span id="110-2"></span>
(2) The [preceding paragraph](#110-1) also applies to companies that do not meet the conditions laid down in the [preceding paragraph](#110-1) but normally have more than twenty permanent employees with voting rights, subject to the proviso that the employees of such companies may also be informed orally. If such company is under no obligation to set up a finance committee, the employees are informed after prior coordination with the works council.

## Subdivision Two: Alterations

<span id="111"></span>
### Section 111: Alterations
---

In companies that normally have more than twenty employees with voting rights the employer has to inform the works council in full and in good time of any proposed alterations which may entail substantial prejudice to the staff or a large sector thereof and consult the works council on the proposed alterations. In companies that have more than 300 employees, the works council may call on the advice of a consultant to support it; [section 80 (4)](#80-4) applies accordingly; the foregoing is without prejudice to [section 80 (3)](#80-3). The following are deemed as alterations for the purposes of sentence 1:

1.  reduction of operations in or closure of the whole or important departments of the establishment;
2.  transfer of the whole or important departments of the establishment;
3.  the amalgamation with other establishments or split-up of establishments;
4.  important changes in the organization, purpose or plant of the establishment;
5.  introduction of entirely new work methods and production processes.

<span id="112"></span>
### Section 112: Reconciliation of interests in the case of alterations; social compensation plan
---

<span id="112-1"></span>
(1) If the employer and the works council reach an agreement to reconcile their interests in connection with the proposed alterations, the said agreement is to be recorded in writing and signed by the employer and the works council; [section 77 (2)](#77-2) sentence 3 applies accordingly. The foregoing also applies to an agreement on full or part compensation for any financial prejudice sustained by staff as a result of the proposed alterations (social compensation plan). The social compensation plan has the effect of a works agreement. [Section 77 (3)](#77-3) is not to be applied to the social compensation plan.

<span id="112-2"></span>
(2) If no reconciliation of interests can be achieved in connection with the proposed alterations or if no agreement is reached on the social compensation plan, the employer or the works council may apply to the **Executive Board of the Federal Employment Agency** for mediation, the Board may entrust other staff members of the **Federal Employment Agency** with this task. If mediation is not applied for or the attempt at mediation is unsuccessful, the employer or the works council may submit the case to the conciliation committee. The chairperson of the conciliation committee may request a member of the **Executive Board of the Federal Employment Agency** or a staff member of the **Federal Employment Agency** appointed by the Board to take part in the proceedings.

<span id="112-3"></span>
(3) The employer and the works council are to submit proposals to the conciliation committee for the settlement of differences on the reconciliation of interests and the social compensation plan. The conciliation committee has to attempt to reconcile the parties. If an agreement is reached, it has to be recorded in writing and signed by the parties and the chairperson.

<span id="112-4"></span>
(4) If no agreement is reached on the social compensation plan, the conciliation committee makes a decision on the drawing up of a social compensation plan. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the works council.

<span id="112-5"></span>
(5) When making a decision pursuant to [paragraph (4)](#112-5), the conciliation committee has to take into account the social interests of the employees concerned while taking care that its decision does not place an unreasonable financial burden on the company. In doing so and within the framework of equitable discretion, the conciliation committee has to be guided by the following principles, in particular:

1.  When compensating in full or part any financial prejudices sustained, in particular by a reduction in income, the lapse of additional benefits or loss of entitlements to company pensions, removal costs or increased travelling costs, it is to provide for payments which generally make allowances for the circumstances of the individual case.
2.  It has to take into account the prospects of the employees concerned on the labour market. It is to exclude from payments employees who may continue to work in reasonable employment in the same establishment or in another establishment of the company or of a company belonging to the combine, but refuse said continued employment; the possibility of continued employment at another location is not alone sufficient grounds for claiming unreasonableness.
    * 2a.  In particular, it is to duly consider the support schemes aimed at avoiding unemployment provided for in **Book Three of the Social Code**.
3.  When calculating the total amount of the social compensation plan payments, it has to take care that the continuance of the company or the jobs remaining after the implementation of the alterations is not jeopardised.

<span id="112a"></span>
### Section 112a: Enforceable social compensation plan in the event of staff cutbacks, establishment of new businesses
---

<span id="112a-1"></span>
(1) Where a planned alteration to the establishment in accordance with [section 111](#111) sentence 3 no. 1 consists only in a reduction of staff, [section 112 (4)](#112-4) and [(5)](#112-5) only applies if the following numbers of employees are to be dismissed for operational reasons:

1.  In establishments with normally less than 60 employees, 20 % of the regularly employed employees, but not less than 6 employees;
2.  In establishments with normally more than 60 and less than 250 employees, 20 % of the regularly employed employees or not less than 37 employees;
3.  In establishments with normally more than 250 and less than 500 employees,15% of the regularly employed employees or not less than 60 employees;
4.  In establishments with normally more than 500 employees, 10 % of the regularly employed employees, but not less than 60 employees.

The leaving of employees on the basis of contract cancellation, occasioned by the employer due to reasons of alteration within the establishment, also counts as dismissal.

<span id="112a-2"></span>
(2) [Section 112 (4)](#112-4) and [(5)](#112-5) does not apply to establishments of a company in the first four years of its existence. This does not apply to new businesses set up in conjunction with the legal restructuring of companies and combines. The start of gainful activity, of which the tax office is to be notified in accordance with **section 138 of the Tax Code**, is authoritative for the time of establishment.

<span id="113"></span>
### Section 113: Indemnities
---

<span id="113-1"></span>
(1) If the employer fails to comply with an agreement on the reconciliation of interests in connection with the alterations proposed without any compelling reasons to do so, the employees who are dismissed as a result of such non-compliance may bring an action in the labour court requesting that the employer should be condemned to pay indemnities; **section 10 of the Protection against Dismissal Act** applies accordingly.

<span id="113-2"></span>
(2) If employees sustain other financial prejudice as a result of a non-compliance covered by [paragraph (1)](#113-1), the employer is to make good such prejudice for a period not exceeding twelve months.

<span id="113-3"></span>
(3) [Paragraphs (1)](#113-1) and [(2)](#113-2) apply accordingly where the employer carries out any proposed alterations within the meaning of [section 111](#111) without having attempted to reach an agreement with the works council on a reconciliation of interests and such action results in dismissals or other financial prejudice to employees.

The foregoing is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the appointment of the electoral board by the labour court.
9.  In respect of crew members on board ship the period within which an election may be contested runs from the date on which the vessel enters, for the first time after the election results have been announced, a port of call located within the territorial scope of this Act or in which there is a seamen’s tribunal. The contestation of an election may also be placed on record with the seamen’s tribunal. If the election to the ship’s committee is contested, the seamen’s tribunal seizes the election records on board.

He or she answers questions concerning the operation of the ship, the voyage and safety on board.

<span id="115-6"></span>

The same applies if the central works council or combine works council fails to appoint the electoral board as stipulated in sentence 3. If no agreement is reached between the employer and the trade unions, the electoral board is appointed by the labour court on application from the employer or a trade union represented in the fleet or at least three crew members with voting rights. [Section 16 (2)](#16-2) sentence 2 and 3 apply accordingly.

A contestation of an election cease to be receivable on the expiry of three months after the election results have been announced. The contestation of an election may also be placed on record with the seamen’s tribunal. The seamen’s tribunal immediately transmits the declaration of contestation to the labour court competent to deal with the contestation.
9.  If the fleet works council consists of crew members, a member of the fleet works council who ceases to be a crew member also ceases to be a member of the fleet works council. The fact of holding office on the fleet works council or an employment covered by no. 2 of [paragraph (3)](#116-3) below may not affect a person’s status as crew member.

(3) Sections [26](#26) to [41](#41) relating to the conduct of business of the works council applies to the fleet works council with the following modifications:

The job to be assigned is determined in agreement with the fleet works council. If no agreement is reached on the assignment of the job the matter is decided by the conciliation committee. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the fleet works council.
3.  Crew members who serve on the fleet works council are to continue to receive their seamen’s pay even if they are employed in the shore office. Benefits in kind are to be compensated at an appropriate rate. If the new job ranks higher than the previous job, the remuneration paid has to be that which corresponds to the new job.
4.  Where the workplace is located outside the place of residence an arrangement which should take account of local conditions is to be made between the fleet works council and the employer as to the accommodation of the crew members elected to the fleet works council. If no agreement is reached the matter is decided by the conciliation committee. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the fleet works council.
5.  The fleet works council has the right to board any ship of the fleet, perform its duties while on board and attend the meetings of the ship’s committee. [Section 115 (7)](#115-7) no. 5 sentence 1 applies accordingly.
6.  While a ship is berthed in a port located within the territorial scope of this Act, the fleet works council may, after notifying the master, appoint hours for consultation aboard and call crew meetings on board.
7.  If the ship does not call at a port located within the territorial scope of this Act within a calendar year, no. 5 and 6 apply to European ports. The locks of the Kiel Canal are not considered as ports.
8.  Notwithstanding no. 6 and 7 consultation hours and crew meetings may also be held in other ports of call, in cases of urgent need, if the employer agrees. If no agreement is reached the matter is decided by the conciliation committee. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the fleet works council.
